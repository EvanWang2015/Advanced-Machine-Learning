# Installing Tensorflow, Theano and Keras in Spyder

I recently got some issues with my computer and had to reinstall my system, including Python. 
I installed python through Anaconda. The default version of Python is 3.6.3. Tensorflow 
couldn't be imported through Spyder. If you are using windows system, you may refer to [this
blog to install Tensorflow, Theano and Keras](https://medium.com/@pushkarmandot/installing-tensorflow-theano-and-keras-in-spyder-84de7eb0f0df)
